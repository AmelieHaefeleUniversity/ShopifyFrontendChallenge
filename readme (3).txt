To Run: Simply download the project to your computer or device and then open the index.html file with safari chrome or any other browser you use and enjoy. 


Design Notes: I used a one column style to increase the website's portability to phones and other devices as it fits the screen more easily. I used a heart and heart broken emoji to signify the like and unlike button as emojis are familiar to users and their representation is already known.
