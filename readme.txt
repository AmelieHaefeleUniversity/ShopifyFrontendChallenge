To Run: Simply download the project to your computer or device and then open the index.html file with safari, chrome, or any other browser you use and enjoy. Please give the API some time to load and fetch data.


Design Notes: I used a one column style to increase the website's portability to phones and other devices as it fits the screen more easily. I used a heart and heart broken emoji to signify the like and unlike button as emojis are familiar to users and their representation is already known.
